# CoreMod

An open source, extensible moderation bot for Discord written in C# using [Discord.Net](https://discordnet.dev/).

## Goal

CoreMod is still in a very early stage of development, so the project scope is subject to change.

The goal of CoreMod is to provide a moderation bot that is easy to use scale. The project architecture is based on Jason Taylor's [Clean Architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) and is designed to scale well with additional features.

The goal of the bot is to provide an easy to use moderation system for Discord servers. The bot will be able to handle moderation tasks such as kicking, banning, muting, and warning users.

A web interface using Discord OAuth2 is planned for the future to allow users to manage their servers and the bot settings without having to use commands.
